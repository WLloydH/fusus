Live Data to Incident Commander


My part in the CPD(Clearwater Police Department) fusus project was to provide real-time data to the incident command dashboard for the active and available resources from our CAD(Computer Aided Dispatch System)

I had the entire CPD in Antarctica during our first smoke test. And they thought this was significant progress.
